- Record insights in "Notes" section

### After the Interview
- Fill out your observations immediately
- Tag interesting quotes
- Note if they're a potential beta tester
- Score their enthusiasm level

## DATA ANALYSIS GUIDE

### How to Analyze Results After 20+ Interviews

#### 1. Quantitative Analysis

**Pain Point Severity** (Section 2.2):
- Calculate average scores for each issue
- Identify top 5 pain points (highest averages)
- Look for consensus (low standard deviation = everyone agrees)

**Feature Priority** (Section 3.1):
- Calculate average ranking for each feature
- Top 5 features = your MVP
- Bottom 5 features = nice-to-have or skip

**Feature Interest** (Section 3.2):
- Calculate % of respondents who rated 4-5 ("would use")
- Features with 70%+ interest = must-have
- Features with 30-70% = include if easy
- Features with <30% = skip for MVP

**Pricing** (Section 5.3):
- Calculate median willingness to pay
- Identify sweet spot (where most people cluster)
- Premium price = 75th percentile
- Budget price = 25th percentile

#### 2. Qualitative Analysis

**Top Pain Points** (Section 2.3):
- Group similar responses into themes
- Count frequency of each theme
- Create "pain point personas" (different archetypes)

**Killer Feature** (Section 3.3):
- Look for patterns in what people say
- If 30%+ say the same thing = make it your hook
- This is your value proposition

**Dream Solution** (Section 8.1):
- Mine for feature ideas you didn't think of
- Look for emotional language (what they REALLY want)
- Identify unmet needs

**Quotes** (Section 10.3):
- Tag quotes by theme
- Use in marketing copy
- Include in pitch deck

#### 3. Segmentation

**Segment by**:
- Number of co-owners (2-3 vs 4+)
- Boat value (€50k vs €500k)
- Tech comfort level
- Years of co-ownership

**Look for**:
- Do different segments have different needs?
- Should you target a specific segment first?
- Are some segments more willing to pay?

#### 4. Decision Criteria

**Build if**:
- ✅ 70%+ of respondents rate top pain points as 4-5 severity
- ✅ 60%+ would pay €15+ per month
- ✅ 50%+ are enthusiastic (score 4-5) about the solution
- ✅ 40%+ want to beta test
- ✅ Clear top 3-5 must-have features emerge

**Don't build if**:
- ❌ No consensus on pain points (fragmented needs)
- ❌ Less than 30% willing to pay anything
- ❌ Current free tools are "good enough" for most
- ❌ Feature requests are all over the map (no focus)
- ❌ Low enthusiasm scores (<3 average)

#### 5. MVP Feature Set

**Process**:
1. Take top 5 features from ranking (Section 3.1)
2. Add features with 70%+ interest (Section 3.2)
3. Cross-reference with "Killer Feature" responses (Section 3.3)
4. Validate against top pain points (Sections 2.2 & 2.3)
5. Remove anything complex or low ROI

**Your MVP** = The intersection of:
- High pain point severity
- High feature interest
- Frequently mentioned as "killer feature"
- Technically feasible in 3-4 months

## INTERVIEW SCRIPT (Optional - for phone/video calls)

### Opening (2 minutes)
```
Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today.

I'm [Your Name], and I'm exploring building a management tool specifically
for boat co-owners. I co-own a boat myself / work in the charter industry,
and I keep hearing about the challenges of managing co-ownership.

This conversation is to learn from your experience - what's working, what's
frustrating, and whether a dedicated app would actually be useful.

There are no right or wrong answers. I'm just trying to understand the real
problems people face.

The interview should take about 20-30 minutes. Sound good?

"Tell me more about that..."
"Can you give me an example?"
"How does that make you feel?"
"What have you tried to solve this?"
"If you could change one thing, what would it be?"
"Why is that important to you?"
```

### Probing Questions
When they mention a pain point:
```
- How often does this happen?
- How much time does it cost you?
- What's the impact when it goes wrong?
- Have you tried to solve this? What happened?
- On a scale of 1-10, how much does this bother you?
```

### Closing (2 minutes)
```
This has been incredibly helpful. A few final questions:

1. Is there anything I didn't ask about that I should have?
2. Do you know other boat co-owners who might want to share their experience?
3. If we build this, would you be interested in trying it early?

Thank you so much for your time and insights. I'll keep you posted on
what we learn and build.
